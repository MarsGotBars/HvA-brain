# Notes

Check out [yesterdays](2024-10-01) note!

## What have I done today

Learned about typography and changed some typography in my own project

## 3 Daily study questions

- Who decided that 16px was enough?
- What if my designer gives me a design with 12 or 14px texts?
- Are there any exceptions to these rules?

## Interesting links / info I found today

- 16px font-size is minimum
- 1.4 line-height is optimaal voor leesbaarheid
- max-width 30em (ongeveer 10 woorden per lijn)
