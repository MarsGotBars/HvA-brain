# Notes

Check out [yesterdays](2024-11-19) note!

## What have I learned today (both CSS & HTML)

1. [Using chrome canary for test features like customizableselect](https://open-ui.org/components/customizableselect/)
2. [details and summary for a drop down](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details)
3. [and animating the details & summary drop down!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idoaw75xjhU)
4. [about the marker pseudo-element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::marker)
5. [Which attributes are usable on which input types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input)

## What will I use in my project?

actually all of the above! Using a drop down is necessary for my project as I need to display a list of filter options (and possibly multiselect them(highly unlikely))
