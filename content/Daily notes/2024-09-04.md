# Notes

## What have I done today
- Setup my Vite-React project (profile card) and created a repository for it.
- Separated most of my card into a few separate components and styled these.

## 3 Daily study questions
- What makes Vite so good?
- Is React worth the effort?
- What is the best way to test cross-browser compatibility (especially) safari on a windows system?
