# Notes
Check out [yesterdays](2025-03-06) note!
## What have I done today

## Cassie Evans | GSAP
GSAP contains a timeline function to set when animations play

### Utility methods
#### utils.random()
built-in ways of randomisation
<sub>Personally prefer doing this bit of js myself...</sub>

#### utils.wrap
js way of doing a css marquee?

#### rough easing
pass in how rough the easing should be, for glitchy animations

#### matchMedia() gsap
can just use regular javascript to matchmedia instead...

#### Container animation
makes it easy to animate scrolling vertically to scroll horizontally and transition into a vertical scroll.

#### Different enter & Exit animations
Also doable with easy js
